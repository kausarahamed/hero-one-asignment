            <p>Staying on task can be difficult, but it can be particularly challenging when you are surrounded by
                constant
                distraction. In today's always-connected world, diversions are nothing more than a click away.</p>

                <h3>Mission</h3>

                <p>Having a personal mission statement is important because it can act as a decision-making guardrail to
                    decipher how you spend your time, how you interact with others and how you do your job. Deciding
                    what to
                    do with your time is equally important as deciding what not to do with your time.</p>

                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>Many nurture the not unnatural, latent fear that any engagement with the future will turn out to be
                    an
                    acknowledgement of their mortality and the transience of their world. Different cultures handle this
                    fear differently. </p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Learning to acknowledge and appreciate the successes of others makes you a good friend and a good
                    person.
                    It might even inspire others to do the same for you. Since you can’t predict the successes of your
                    friends, this goal is more open-ended.</p>

            <h3>Without Limits</h3>
            <p>Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not
                sustain. Great staff could leave. Your program won’t reach as many young people as it could.</p>
